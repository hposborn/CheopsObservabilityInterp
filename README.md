# CheopsObservabilityInterp

Until ESA makes a useable Cheops observability web tool, here is what I use to figure out if a target is within Cheops' cone of shame.
This uses the interpolated maps of [ESA Cheops Sky](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/cheops/the-cheops-sky) to estimate the time a target is observable, what the max efficiency is, and what the combined observability time is (all assuming a minimum threshold of 50% efficiency).

Check out [Example.ipynb](Example.ipynb) for a quick example.
